# Markovian Image Generator
## Created by Benjamin Steenkamer, 2018
An attempt to generate images using Markov chains.  

## Issues
With black and white images, it just generates noise (as I expected).  
With color images, it takes a very long time to read in the image data, 
even for small resolution images (e.g. 512x512).  
With color images, it always says a pixel wasn't found while generating an image.
